1.0.2 by Lasse-B

- works in Launch or Apply mode, depending on whether or not EDLaunch is running
- moved the info messages to them bottom of the window and gave them their own sections
- removed the requirement to be in the same folder as EDLauncher but can still start EDLaunch if it was running when Account Switcher came up



1.0.1 by HandH111

- Replaced the apply with a launch button
- Added a label for some informative messages during launch
- when launching, stop existing EDlaunch first, then apply change, and start EDlaunch
- uses the same name as the script for the ini file name instead of the accounts.ini

Only requirement is to put the exe or au3 file in the EDlauncher directory
