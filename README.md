v1.0.0

If you have multiple Elite: Dangerous accounts you probably know this too well:
- open the launcher and log in using another set of login credentials
- firing up your email client waiting for the verification code
- pasting the verification code into the launcher
Repeat every time you switch accounts.

Well, no more. With E:D Account Switcher you only need to log into the launcher once per account to set up your accounts database. Once that's done, you can switch between accounts with just a couple of mouse button clicks.

- Log into your account via the Elite Dangerous launcher, so that the "play" button appears
- Fire up E:D Account Switcher or click the "Add New Account" button
- fill in the account name as you see fit

Repeat steps 1 through 3 for every game account you want to be able to quickly switch between. This is a one time process. After you've added your accounts to the database you can switch between accounts like this:

- close the Elite: Dangerous launcher
- fire up E:D Account Switcher, select your saved account and click "Apply"
- start the Elite: Dangerous launcher



Noteworthy stuff:

The account data that E:D Account Switcher saves in its database is tied to the computer that you logged into the account with. While you can copy this database between computers, the machine token which is part of the account data is individually calculated by the launcher for every account and computer. What this means is that chances are relatively high you need to go through the accounts set up process again if you want to use E:D Account Switcher and your game accounts on another computer.

If you have different editions (https://support.elitedangerous.com/kb/faq.php?id=108) of the game switching between accounts still works, so no worries there, however ED's launcher may still want to reinstall the game. If you're a bit tech savvy you can read up on soft links, symbolic links and junctions here: http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html#introduction . If you don't have an idea of what to do after reading the info on the site I think it's best if you just let the Elite Dangerous launcher run its course.
